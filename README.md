# Hi! I'm Pip/Santashi. 🦇💖

I recently learned JavaScript via the excellent Northcoders bootcamp. 🙇

I speak English 🇬🇧 (native), Japanese 🇯🇵, Latin 📜 and Ancient Greek 📜 (intermediate) and I'm learning German 🇩🇪.

In my spare time I like writing stories 📚📝, drawing 🎨, hiking 🥾 and playing games 🎲🎮.
